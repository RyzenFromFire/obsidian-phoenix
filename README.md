# Ryzen Theme for Obsidian
My personal CSS theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
Mostly red, orange, yellow, grey, and black color palette.
Modified from the gruvbox and [Atom](https://github.com/kognise/obsidian-atom) themes.
Created with occasional assistance from the [Obsidian community discord](https://obsidian.md/community).
