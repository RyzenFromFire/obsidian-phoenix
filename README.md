# Ryzen Theme for Obsidian
My personal CSS theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). 

Dark theme only. Mostly red, orange, yellow, grey, and black color palette.

Built on Obsidian v0.12.19.

Modified from the gruvbox and [Atom](https://github.com/kognise/obsidian-atom) themes.
Created with occasional assistance from the [Obsidian community discord](https://obsidian.md/community).

### Installation
1. Download [ryzen.css](https://github.com/RyzenFromFire/ryzen-theme-obsidian) and place in your `.obsidian\themes` folder.
2. In Obsidian, under `Appearance` settings, click the `Manage` button under the `Themes` entry, and click `Use` under this theme.

### Addons for Optimal Experience
The font I use for this is [San Francisco (but for Windows)](https://github.com/blaisck/sfwin), but Monospace comes close.

I also use my [personal checkboxes snippet](https://github.com/RyzenFromFire/ryzen-checkboxes), which was enabled for the demo screenshot and which I recommend using.
