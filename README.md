# Phoenix Theme for Obsidian
My personal CSS theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). 

Mostly red, orange, yellow, grey, and black color palette, with a tinge of blue and green.

Latest verified compatible version: Obsidian v1.5.3 (older versions are not guaranteed to be functional, but most everything after 1.0.0 should be).

Originally based the [gruvbox](https://github.com/insanum/obsidian_gruvbox) and [Atom](https://github.com/kognise/obsidian-atom) themes, heavily modified since.
Created with occasional assistance from the [Obsidian community discord](https://obsidian.md/community).

This theme is primarily meant to be used in Live Preview (WYSIWYG) mode, so the preview side isn't as polished and may appear different than intended.

### Installation
1. Download the latest zipped file from [Releases](https://github.com/RyzenFromFire/obsidian-phoenix/releases), extract, and place the `theme.css` and `manifest.json` in a folder named `Phoenix` in your `.obsidian\themes` folder.
2. In Obsidian, under `Appearance` settings, under the `Themes` entry, select `Phoenix` from the dropdown menu.
