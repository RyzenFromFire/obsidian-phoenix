# Ryzen Theme for Obsidian
My personal CSS theme for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md). 

Dark theme only. Mostly red, orange, yellow, grey, and black color palette.

Built on Obsidian v0.12.19.

Modified from the [gruvbox](https://github.com/insanum/obsidian_gruvbox) and [Atom](https://github.com/kognise/obsidian-atom) themes.
Created with occasional assistance from the [Obsidian community discord](https://obsidian.md/community).

### Installation
1. Download [Ryzen.css](https://github.com/RyzenFromFire/ryzen-theme-obsidian/blob/main/Ryzen.css) and place in your `.obsidian\themes` folder.
2. In Obsidian, under `Appearance` settings, click the `Manage` button under the `Themes` entry, and click `Use` under this theme.

### Addons for Optimal Experience
I use [CodeMirror Options](https://github.com/nothingislost/obsidian-codemirror-options) for some limited live preview/WYSIWYG improvements. Settings: Hide Markdown Tokens on, `task` removed from hidden token list. Style checkboxes off. Render embeds, math, codeblocks on. All settings without warnings under Syntax Highlighting on.

I also use my [personal checkboxes snippet](https://github.com/RyzenFromFire/ryzen-checkboxes), which was enabled for the demo screenshot and which I recommend using.
